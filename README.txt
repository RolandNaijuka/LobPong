**************LOB PONG************
1. Unzip the compressed folder, CSC Project 4_Roland&Prince
2. Open it in your favourite Java compiler
3. There are 2 classes;
	a) LobPong.java
	b) PlayGame.java
3.a)
The class LobPong.java contains the paddle seetings, ball settings, the clock, and other 
settings that are necessary for the game controls.
*Speed increase*
The speed of the ball increases as score increases. However this increase is small if the
score is still below 100.
The speed also increases as the levels increase. Each level is 60s ==1 minute
**paddle movement**
The paddle moves right or left. It maintains its y position (height from the y -origin)

3.b)
The class PlayGame contains the frame and the menu bars which allow the user to restart, 
pause, resume, or exit the game. It also contains the main method for playing the game.
*the frame is not resizable*
***The game is played in this class****

**********EXTRA CREDIT
*I have included a menu for restarting, pausing, resuming and exiting options
